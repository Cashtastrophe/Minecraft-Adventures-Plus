> A compilation of mods that overhauls Minecraft while also adding its own features without drifting to far from the base game!

## **✨ Vanilla+**
> I’ve always wanted a modpack that adds features that fit naturally with the game, but the ones I’ve tried either added too much or too little. So I decided to make my own modpack that adds many vanilla+ features without drastically changing the game. I hope you enjoy this modpack just as much as I did making it!

## **📕 Features**

- ### 🌍 Terrain
  > Explore over 100+ new biomes — from towering volcanoes and floating islands to lush jungles, desert oases, and peaceful aspen forests. All made with vanilla blocks.

- ### 🏠 New & Overhauled Structures
    > Villages, dungeons, temples, ruins, and other structures have been revitalized to make them more of a challenge that grants greater rewards.
 
- ### 🦆 New Mobs
  > Find more than 50 real-world animals and improved vanilla mobs that bring the world to life, including ducks, elephants, crocodiles, seagulls, and many more.

- ### 🍳 Cooking
  > New crops expand the cooking and baking side of the game. Many meals can be made that grant different beneficial effects the more complex they are.

- ### ⚙️ Quality Of Life Features
  > Small tweaks make survival, exploration, and building in Minecraft smoother — while keeping a vanilla feel.

- ### 📅 Seasons
  > Dynamic seasons shift crops and weather across the year — adding variety, immersion, and new challenges to your world.

- ### 🧭 Navigation & Exploration
  > The Atlas works as both a mini-map and world map, but unlike most mods it requires maps to expand. While in your invintory, compasses show coordinates, while clocks track days & time.

- ### ⚡ Optimized & Shaders
  > Optimized configs ensure smooth performance, with pre-enabled Complementary Reimagined Shaders for an improved graphical experience.

- ### ➕ And More
  > And many other features found over 150+ mods!
