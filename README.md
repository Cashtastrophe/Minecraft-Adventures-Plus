> A compilation of mods that overhauls Minecraft while also adding its own features without drifting to far from the base game!

## **✨ Vanilla+**
> I’ve always wanted a modpack that adds features that fit naturally with the game, but the ones I’ve tried either added too much or too little. So I decided to make my own modpack that adds many vanilla+ features without drastically changing the game. I hope you enjoy this modpack just as much as I did making it!

## **📕 Features**

- ### 🌍 Terrain
  > Explore 100+ new biomes, ranging from vast deserts to lush jungles. With so many unique landscapes, choosing the perfect base location won’t be easy 😅

- ### 🏠 New & Overhauled Structures
    > Many existing structures have been fully reworked, offering greater challenge and better rewards. On top of that, brand-new structures have been added throughout the world to discover.
 
- ### 🦆 New Mobs
  > Encounter tons of new real-world mobs as you explore. Vanilla mobs have also received biome-based texture variants, making the world feel more alive and diverse.

- ### 🍳 Cooking
  > A wide variety of new crops and food options expand cooking and farming, making survival more in-depth and rewarding.

- ### ⚙️ Quality Of Life Features
  > Small but impactful tweaks that make gameplay wayyyyy more enjoyable.

- ### 📅 Seasons
  > Experience four seasons that change the weather and leaf colors across biomes. Crops now grow only during certain seasons adding a challenge to farming.

- ### 🧭 Navigation & Exploration
  > The Atlas acts as both a mini-map and world map, but unlike most map mods, it must be expanded using actual maps.
  
- ### 🏞️ Shaders
  > This modpack comes with Complementary Reimagined Shaders pre-enabled for a significantly improved visual experience.
  
- ### ➕ And More
  > And many other features found in over 200+ mods!
  >
  > The pack also includes an _untested_ host multiplayer feature, which can be enabled by clicking “Host World” in-game.
